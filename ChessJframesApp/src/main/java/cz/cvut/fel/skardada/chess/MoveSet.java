 * MoveSet is a class that describes the way a chess piece can move on the board (barring any special moves, such as casteling).
 * It comprises of two parts: a set of vectors which give a direction of the movement 
 * and distance which describes how many squares in a given direction can the piece move - it is an upper limit.
